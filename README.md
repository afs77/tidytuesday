# tidytuesday
In this repo are all my contributions to the #TidyTuesday, shared on twitter (amandafanelli). <br>
Each folder contains the weekly datasets I explored in a year. 


## About the tidytuesday project <br>
This is a weekly social data project, that was originated from the R4DS Online Learning Community and the R for Data Science textbook. <br>
Every monday, a new dataset is shared on [this repo](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday). Everyone is welcomed to explore the data, create a visualization, and share it on twitter.
